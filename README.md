Programming an autonomous robot with the ATMEGA324a microcontroller using the <avr/io.h> library. The entire project has been coded in C++.  The project consisted in coding a robot so that he would follow a black tape and would make the right turns when necessary, mostly when there's an obstacle blocking his way. For it to be possible, I had to code a sensor that would guide him and tell him how far he was from a wall. Furthermore, the robot had a photo resistor which would make him follow any source of light (that of an Iphone for example). At the end of the path, he had to play music signaling that it was over.
